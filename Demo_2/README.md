  - Put the UINavigation controller as an option under a UITabBarController
  - Create an extension that has at least one property and one method
  - Show data in a UITableView or UICollectionView, using 2 cells
    - In one cell, use the tag to bind the UIViews to your data
    - In another cell, use a custom UITableViewCell class to bind
  - The table or collection should be refreshable using the UIRefreshControl
