# Demo 4

#### Description
Use the following list of features as your guide:

    - Allow a user to add, update and delete records:
        - Make a table or collection view that shows the records
        - Implement an add button that takes the user to an empty form view, then give them a save <br> and cancel button to either persist or lose their changes
        - Allow the user to select an existing record from the table/collection view, then edit <br> that record in the previously mentioned form view
    - Make a button that when touched, will show and enable a view that covers the entire screen.
        - The view should have an image or text pertinent to the view controller
        - Make a tap gesture recognizer associated to the view that hides the view again
        - Make a message app extension that does anything

And an additional list of things you can try (pick at least of couple), in no particular order:

    - When using core data, use the DictionaryResultType for fetching instead of the default
    - Allow logout of the app, i.e. remove the core data stack appropriately and re-initialize it
    - Animate something (this can be something interactive, like a game using gestures and images <br> or other views, or just overriding and controlling a default animation e.g. the animation to edit a table row)
    - Use a long or double tap gesture
    - Implement pan and zoom on a photo
    - Have a button that opens an action sheet
        - One action sheet item should open a UIActivityController and share something
    - Open a file (image, document, whatever) from iCloud or messages (or any other app) into your app <br> and do something with it
    - Show a map and put in a pin or other view to interact
