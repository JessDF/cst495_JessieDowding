#### Note to self:
* In Swift, any variable declared with the let keyword is considered a constant and is read-only and thread-safe. Declare the variable with the var keyword however, and it becomes mutable and not thread-safe unless the data type is designed to be so.
* The Swift collection types like Array and Dictionary are not thread-safe when declared mutable. Although many threads can read a mutable instance of Array simultaneously without issue, itâ€™s not safe to let one thread modify the array while another is reading it.
